        As a senior at Purdue University, I am a driven and experienced software developer seeking to leverage my skills and passion in a challenging software engineer role. My journey in programming began at a young age, and I have since honed my abilities through creating iOS applications and participating in impactful internships and projects. I am eager to bring my technical expertise, creativity, and drive to a dynamic and fast-paced work environment, and am ready to contribute to the success of a company as a full-time software engineer following graduation.
